    \ authorization in the United States.Credit: Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto/Getty\n\n\n\
    A week after granting an emergency-use authorization for the country’s first COVID-19\
    \ vaccine, US regulators have followed with a second: another RNA vaccine, this\
    \ one made by Moderna of Cambridge, Massachusetts.The emergency-use authorization\
    \ followed quickly after a panel of external advisers to the US Food and Drug\
    \ Administration (FDA) voted unanimously, with one abstention, to recommend use\
    \ of the vaccine on 17 December. One week earlier, the agency authorized a similar\
    \ vaccine made by Pfizer of New York City and BioNTech of Mainz, Germany, about\
    \ a week after UK regulatory authorities did the same.\n\nUS authorization of\
    \ first COVID vaccine marks new phase in safety monitoring\nThe speed of these\
    \ authorizations reflects the urgency of the pandemic, and is a testament to the\
    \ scientific advances that made rapid vaccine development possible, said immunologist\
    \ James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee,\
    \ at the panel meeting on Thursday. “To go from having a sequence of a virus in\
    \ January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement.”\
    \ The authorization is a first for Moderna, a ten-year-old biotechnology company\
    \ that had long pledged to revolutionize medicine by harnessing RNA as a therapeutic\
    \ agent, but had yet to push a drug or vaccine all the way through to the clinic.\
    \ It will join a growing list of organizations with coronavirus vaccines that\
    \ are being deployed around the world, including teams in China and Russia. In\
    \ the United States, the vaccines offer a glimmer of hope amid the prospect of\
    \ a tough winter. The country is logging thousands of deaths from COVID-19 each\
    \ day, and this is expected to rise over the winter holiday season. Coronavirus\
    \ infections are so rampant that Moderna was able to reach the primary endpoint\
    \ of its trial five months earlier than expected, said Jacqueline Miller, senior\
    \ vice-president and head of infectious diseases at the company.RNA vaccineModerna’\
    s vaccine, which was developed in collaboration with the US National Institute\
    \ of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, works in the same way as the one produced\
    \ by Pfizer and BioNTech. Both consist of RNA molecules encased in lipid nanoparticles.\
    \ The RNA in both vaccines encodes a slightly modified form of the SARS-CoV-2\
    \ protein known as spike, which enables the virus to infect human cells.Once taken\
    \ up by cells, the RNA is used to produce the protein, which then triggers an\
    \ immune response. The RNA does not enter the nucleus where the cell’s genome\
    \ resides, and is degraded by the cell within a day of the injection.\n\nCOVID\
    \ vaccine excitement builds as Moderna reports third positive result\nLike Pfizer’\
    s vaccine, Moderna’s seems to be highly effective — about 94% — at preventing\
    \ symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Its safety profile is also similar to Pfizer’\
    s, with fatigue, headaches and pain at the site of injection among the most often\
    \ cited side effects.Since the Pfizer vaccine was rolled out in the United Kingdom\
    \ and the United States, there have been occasional reports of recipients experiencing\
    \ severe allergic reactions called anaphylaxis after being injected. There have\
    \ been no signs of such reactions so far in the Moderna trial, which excluded\
    \ people who have had anaphylactic reactions to previous vaccines, but not those\
    \ with other allergies, such as reactions to food.The two vaccines differ in the\
    \ composition of the lipid nanoparticle that encases the RNA, and Moderna’s formulation\
    \ allows the vaccine to be stored at higher temperature than Pfizer’s, which must\
    \ be kept at −70 °C, much colder than a normal freezer. Moderna’s vaccine can\
    \ be stored in a −20 °C freezer for 6 months, and in a refrigerator (at about\
    \ 4 °C) for 30 days. This promises to streamline the logistics of deploying the\
    \ vaccine, particularly in rural areas and in countries with limited health-care\
    \ infrastructure.Continuing trialsFDA advisers spent much of the 17 December committee\
    \ meeting discussing when and how to offer a vaccine to participants in the placebo\
    \ arm of Moderna’s trial after an emergency-use authorization is granted. Once\
    \ a coronavirus vaccine becomes available, participants might choose to leave\
    \ the trial to guarantee that they can get a jab. Maintaining the integrity of\
    \ clinical trials after vaccine authorization — to collect data on long-term safety\
    \ and the duration of protection — is a looming challenge for developers.Last\
    \ week, Pfizer proposed that when its participants become eligible to receive\
    \ a vaccine as part of a national roll-out, study investigators will tell them\
    \ whether they received the vaccine or a placebo. Moderna has instead proposed\
    \ to ‘unblind’ its whole trial at once after it receives an emergency-use authorization,\
    \ telling all of its participants which treatment they have received, and offering\
    \ to vaccinate those in the placebo arm using doses that had already been set\
    \ aside for the clinical trial.\n\nWhy emergency COVID-19 vaccine approvals pose\
    \ a dilemma for scientists: \nSome FDA advisers cautioned that this approach would\
    \ sacrifice valuable weeks of data collection, and allow some participants to\
    \ receive the vaccine ahead of others in similar priority groups in their communities.\
    \ Others argued that although the approach is not ideal, it might be necessary\
    \ given the complexity of the vaccine roll-out in the United States, where individual\
    \ state and local governments will set their own priorities. “It’s such a hodgepodge\
    \ here, it’s impractical,” said biostatistician Jeannette Lee at the University\
    \ of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.Offering trial participants\
    \ the vaccine could help the company keep them enrolled in the study, so that\
    \ it can continue to collect data about safety and immunity, said Lindsey Baden,\
    \ an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,\
    \ Massachusetts, who was asked by Moderna to speak about the issue to the committee.\
    \ Some healthcare workers who participated in the trial were already leaving to\
    \ get the Pfizer vaccine, he said. “If we lose our volunteers the opportunity\
    \ to learn anything further will be substantially impaired,” he said. “We have\
    \ to be practical.”\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03593-7\n\nUpdates\

    \ the Environmental Protection Agency.Credit: N. C. Department of Environmental\
    \ Quality\n\n\nUS president-elect Joe Biden has nominated Michael Regan, North\
    \ Carolina’s top environmental regulator, to lead the country’s Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency (EPA) — and scientists and environmentalists are optimistic.Regan,\
    \ who will now need to be confirmed by the US Senate, joins other experienced\
    \ appointees whom Biden has tasked with implementing his historic climate agenda.\
    \ These include an envoy who will handle international climate negotiations and\
    \ a coordinator to ensure that goals are achieved at home.\n\nCan Joe Biden make\
    \ good on his revolutionary climate agenda?\n“This shows the Biden team is really\
    \ going to follow through on the bold climate commitments they put forward,” says\
    \ Leah Stokes, a climate-policy researcher at the University of California, Santa\
    \ Barbara. It’s a massive political shift, she says, “and it puts the country\
    \ on track to make climate change the centre of our economic policy”.Regan spent\
    \ more than nine years working in the EPA’s air-quality programme under former\
    \ presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and another eight years at the Environmental\
    \ Defense Fund, an advocacy group based in New York City. For the past four, he\
    \ has led the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, where he earned\
    \ the support of many environmentalists by standing up to chemical and energy\
    \ companies.“Climate change is the most significant challenge humanity faces.\
    \ We’ll make meaningful progress together by listening to every voice — from our\
    \ youth & frontline communities to scientists & our workforce. I will be honored\
    \ to be part of that work as EPA Administrator,” said Regan on Twitter on 18 December.Rebuilding\
    \ the EPAIf confirmed, Regan will inherit an agency demoralized by four years\
    \ under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration sidelined scientists\
    \ at the agency and disregarded scientific evidence in an unprecedented effort\
    \ to scale back environmental and public-health protections. Current and former\
    \ EPA staff recently told Nature about their hopes that Biden can turn things\
    \ around, although they also highlighted some big challenges he’ll face in doing\
    \ so.\n\nScience under siege: behind the scenes at Trump’s troubled environment\
    \ agency\nRegan has experience with such situations. When he joined North Carolina’\
    s Department of Environmental Quality in 2017, under newly elected Democratic\
    \ governor Roy Cooper, staff felt undermined by the previous Republican governor’\
    s industry-friendly policies, says Jeremy Symons, an environmental consultant\
    \ in Arlington, Virginia, who worked with Regan at the Environmental Defense Fund.\
    \ Regan was able to rebuild the agency and improve the state’s processes for chemical\
    \ regulation and disposal of residual coal-ash waste from coal-fired power plants,\
    \ says Symons.“Michael Regan will be exactly the kind of administrator that the\
    \ EPA needs to fix the damage that was done under four years of Trump and tackle\
    \ the climate and health crisis facing Americans,” he adds.The Environmental Protection\
    \ Network in Washington DC, an organization formed by EPA alumni to speak out\
    \ against Trump’s undermining of the agency, also endorses Regan’s appointment.\
    \ Michael Regan “has the background and experience to tackle ongoing threats to\
    \ people’s health and the environment, profound challenges of #climatechange and\
    \ systemic environmental injustice”, the group posted on Twitter on 17 December.Environmental\
    \ justiceRegan is expected to put new emphasis on environmental justice, to protect\
    \ poor and under-represented communities that are disproportionately impacted\
    \ by pollution and climate change. In North Carolina, he created the state's first\
    \ Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board to address these issues. Biden\
    \ put emphasis on environmental justice during his campaign for president, promising\
    \ to invest 40% of his US$2-trillion climate plan in disadvantaged communities.Regan\
    \ “has the experience, understands the challenges faced by environmental-justice\
    \ communities, and has demonstrated a commitment to addressing them”, said Peggy\
    \ Shepard in an e-mail to Nature. Shepard is co-founder and executive director\
    \ of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, an advocacy group based in New York.Climate\
    \ cabinetAt the EPA, one of Regan’s jobs will be to craft regulations to limit\
    \ greenhouse-gas emissions from vehicles and industry — an effort that is intended\
    \ to sit at the heart of Biden’s strategy to mitigate climate change. But Biden’\
    s climate agenda is broad: he has committed to ramping up clean energy production,\
    \ expanding low-carbon infrastructure and reaching zero greenhouse-gas emissions\
    \ from the power sector by 2035. Meeting those goals will require action across\
    \ the federal government, and Biden is already assembling a team of high-profile\
    \ climate appointees to advance that effort.\n\nCan Joe Biden rebuild the ravaged\
    \ US Environmental Protection Agency?\nOn the international front, former secretary\
    \ of state John Kerry will serve as climate envoy, leading the administration’\
    s effort to reintegrate the country into the Paris climate agreement. Biden has\
    \ also appointed Gina McCarthy, a staunch environmentalist and former EPA head,\
    \ as his US climate czar. In this position, McCarthy, who helped implement former\
    \ president Barack Obama’s climate agenda, will coordinate climate action across\
    \ all federal agencies. Neither of these team members need to be confirmed by\
    \ the Senate.These and other appointments signal that Biden is gearing up for\
    \ action on all fronts, says Symons, who is part of the Climate 21 Project, an\
    \ independent group of academics, policy specialists and former government officials\
    \ that has crafted a blueprint for federal climate action. “What we were looking\
    \ for is a White House structure that could rapidly mobilize the entire government\
    \ to act on climate change,” he says, and so far, “there’s no question that president-elect\
    \ Biden is exceeding our expectations.”To read more about Biden's picks for science\
    \ agency heads and advisers, see Nature’s updated guide.\nEPA leader\n\nThe US\
    \ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) safeguards public health and the environment\
    \ by assessing and regulating the risks posed by chemicals and pollutants. It\
    \ has a large role in climate-change mitigation by crafting rules that limit greenhouse-gas\
    \ emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: left, Joshua Roberts/Getty; right, Al Drago/Bloomberg\

    \n\n\n\n\n\nLightning typically forms with the aid of warm air, which is why it\
    \ has historically been rare in the Arctic.Credit: Tommy Eliassen/Science Photo\
    \ Library\n\n\nLightning is striking the Arctic many times more often than it\
    \ did a decade ago, a study suggests — and the rate could soon double. The findings\
    \ demonstrate yet another way Earth’s climate could be changing as the planet\
    \ warms, although not all researchers agree that the trend is real.Robert Holzworth,\
    \ an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle and leader\
    \ of the study, defends the findings. “We’re seeing a symptom of global climate\
    \ change,” he says. Holzworth is director of the World Wide Lightning Location\
    \ Network (WWLLN), the collection of ground-based sensors that measured the data.\
    \ He reported the results on 8 December at a virtual meeting of the American Geophysical\
    \ Union (and published them before peer review as a preprint1).\n\nThe Arctic\
    \ is burning like never before — and that’s bad news for climate change\nAnother\
    \ lightning-detection network, whose records do not extend as far back as those\
    \ Holzworth studied, does not find the same increase.Whether or not lightning\
    \ is increasing in the Arctic could have a significant impact on the region. The\
    \ past two years have set records for the largest area of land burnt by wildfires\
    \ — some of them ignited by lightning — and the most carbon dioxide emitted in\
    \ the Arctic since records began. More lightning would mean even more chances\
    \ that wildfires will start, which could in turn put even more climate-altering\
    \ soot and gases into the air.Polar lightningLightning forms when ice crystals\
    \ inside convecting storm clouds — those filled with roiling air currents fed\
    \ by warm air — collide and transfer electrical charge. A charge separation builds\
    \ up until it hits a threshold, and a lightning stroke is released. Some researchers\
    \ have predicted that global warming will lead to more convective storms and lightning\
    \ worldwide as air and ocean temperatures rise2. However, some modelling studies\
    \ suggest the opposite3.Nonetheless, the World Meteorological Organization in\
    \ Geneva, Switzerland, added lightning to its list of ‘essential climate variables’\
    \ in 2016, meaning that observations of lightning could help researchers to track\
    \ the changing global climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Robert Holzworth/University\
    \ of Washington\n\n\nThe Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet,\
    \ so changes in lightning might be most apparent there. August 2019 saw the most\
    \ northerly stroke ever detected — just 52 kilometres from the North Pole — according\
    \ to the Finnish company Vaisala, headquartered in Vantaa, which runs a lightning-detection\
    \ network. And a July 2014 storm over the Canadian Arctic caused more than 15,000\
    \ lightning strokes north of the Arctic Circle4.Lightning in the Arctic is normally\
    \ rare, accounting for around 0.5% of all global strokes detected by the WWLLN.\
    \ But Holzworth and his colleagues found that the number of annual summertime\
    \ lightning strokes above a latitude of 65° N rose from around 35,000 in 2010\
    \ to nearly 250,000 this year (see ‘Arctic lightning rising’). The scientists\
    \ studied the months of June, July and August, when nearly all Arctic lightning\
    \ occurs. They found increasing numbers of lightning strokes across the Arctic,\
    \ with most of the activity happening around northern Siberia.Verifying a trendTracking\
    \ trends in lightning can be difficult because detection networks grow more efficient\
    \ over time, as advanced sensors are added. So Holzworth and his colleagues ran\
    \ several analyses to confirm that there was more Arctic lightning happening,\
    \ not just more being detected. “There’s no question about it,” he says.\n\nScientists\
    \ probe lightning hotspot to predict future strikes\nVaisala’s network has not\
    \ recorded the same trend. Its data go back only to 2012, rather than to 2010.\
    \ But “we don’t see an unambiguous trend toward more lightning at more extreme\
    \ latitudes”, says Ryan Said, a meteorologist and lightning analyst in Vaisala’\
    s office in Louisville, Colorado.In places that see relatively little lightning,\
    \ such as the Arctic, just a couple of intense thunderstorms can cause a proportionally\
    \ huge rise in the total number of lightning strokes detected in a given year,\
    \ Said notes. With so much year-to-year variability, it can be hard to isolate\
    \ long-term trends.Some researchers in the community say Holzworth’s findings\
    \ make sense. The work “supports the wider view of a lightning-richer future for\
    \ the Arctic”, says Sander Veraverbeke, an Earth-systems scientist at the Free\
    \ University of Amsterdam. In 2017, Veraverbeke and his colleagues reported that\
    \ lightning was igniting more wildfires, farther north, than in the past in parts\
    \ of Alaska and Canada5.\n\nArctic sea ice hits second-lowest level on record\n\
    One way to verify Holzworth’s work would be to survey Indigenous and other communities\
    \ living at high latitudes, says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University\
    \ in Oxford, Ohio, who studies Arctic wildfire.Another way is to follow up with\
    \ further lightning-detection studies. Holzworth’s work shows “an interesting\
    \ correlation” with changes in global temperature, says Antti Mäkelä, a lightning\
    \ specialist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki. By next year,\
    \ Mäkelä and his colleagues will have 20 years of data from a lightning-detection\
    \ system that spans Norway, Sweden, Finland and Estonia6 — and they plan to analyse\
    \ the data set to see whether there has been an increase in lightning in northern\
    \ Scandinavia.\n\nNature 589, 11-12 (2021)\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03561-1\n\
